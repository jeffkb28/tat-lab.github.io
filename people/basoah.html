      <p>
        I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Human Centered Design and Engineering at the University of Washington, pursuing a Doctorate in Human-Computer Interaction. My research focuses on comprehending the unintended effects that everyday digital and AI technology exerts on our daily lives. Specifically, I aim to understand Black user experience with AI technology and their expectations, experiences, and perceptions of the technology in this growing space.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my investigations, I delve into the design and creation of technologies, exploring the cultural assumptions and values embedded in them, and examining their role in shaping our lives. Ultimately, I aspire to scrutinize the cascading impact that awareness of technology use disparities has on society. I am particularly interested in identifying ways to mitigate any negative effects while promoting and supporting the positive ones.
